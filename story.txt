Once upon a time, Ethan, a cs400 student, discovered a fantastic game called Minecraft. He found the game so fancinating that
he played it all day long. At this time he realized that he didn't submit the early submission of second project.
Therefore, he decided to submit his assignment early next time - Jiong Chen
And then he was happy - Shruti Sharma
